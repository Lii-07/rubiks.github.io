        <h2>Solving The Cube</h2>
        <p>Learning to solve a Rubik's Cube can be a rewarding journey that combines patience, practice, and the understanding of key solving methods.</p>
        <h3 id="steps">Learning to Solve The Cube</h3>
        <ol>
            <br><li><strong>Understand the Cube:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the structure of the Rubik's Cube, its colors, and the movements of its individual pieces.</li>

            <br><li><strong>Learn Notation:</strong> Understand the standard notation used to describe the cube's movements (like F for Front, B for Back, R for Right, etc.).</li>

            <br><li><strong>Beginner's Method:</strong> Start with the Beginner's Method, which involves solving the cube layer by layer.</li>

            <br><li><strong>Practice Algorithms:</strong> Memorize and practice algorithms (sequences of moves) that are used to manipulate specific pieces without disturbing the rest of the cube.</li>

            <br><li><strong>Learn Advanced Methods (Optional):</strong> Consider exploring more advanced methods like <a href="https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/advanced-cfop-fridrich/" target="_blank">CFOP</a> or <a href="https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/different-rubiks-cube-solving-methods/roux-method/" target="_blank">Roux</a> method for faster solving times.</li>
            <br><li><strong>Practice, Practice, Practice:</strong> Solve the cube regularly to improve your solving speed and algorithm recognition.</li>
