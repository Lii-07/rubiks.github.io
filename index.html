<h2>Steps to Solve a Rubik's Cube</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Cross:</strong> Start by solving a cross on one face of the cube, matching the colors of the edge pieces with the center pieces. This creates a cross shape on one face.</li>
  <li><strong>First Layer Corners:</strong> Complete the first layer by solving the corner pieces around the cross. Match the corner pieces with the adjacent edge pieces to form complete color groups on the first layer.</li>
  <li><strong>Second Layer Edges (F2L):</strong> Solve the second layer (middle layer) by pairing up the edge pieces with the corresponding corner pieces from the first layer. This step is often referred to as F2L (First Two Layers).</li>
  <li><strong>Top Cross (OLL):</strong> Orient the last layer (top layer) edges to form a cross on the top face. This step is known as OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer).</li>
  <li><strong>Top Layer Corners (PLL):</strong> Permute the last layer corners to complete the entire top layer. This step is called PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer).</li>
  <li><strong>Final Adjustment:</strong> Adjust the cube's layers as needed to solve any remaining misaligned pieces and bring the cube back to its solved state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, each step involves a series of algorithms (sequences of moves) that manipulate specific pieces of the cube without disturbing the solved parts. Practice each step individually and gradually combine them to solve the entire cube efficiently. As you become more comfortable with the Beginner's Method, you can explore more advanced solving methods for faster solving times.</p>
